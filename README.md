# Digit-Classifier
Softmax Neural Network that classifies digits 0-9, 96% test accuracy. the architecture is 3 layers: 25, 15 and 10 neurons and Relu, Relu and the Softmax activation functions respectively. Uses 60000 samples to train and test with an 80/20 split respectively. 
I built this as a result of what I learned in Stanfordâ€™s "Advanced Learning Algorithms" course.
